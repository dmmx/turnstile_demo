Help me create a design specification for an AWS VPC. The VPC should
have one public subnet and one private subnet. Each subnet should have
the capacity for 16 IP addresses.

The public subnet should allow ssh, http, and https traffic from the
public internet.

The private subnet should only allow ssh, http, and https traffic
from the public subnet.

The technology stack should only include AWS Cloudformation YAML files.
These files will later be processed by the AWS CLI.

All resources should be tagged with the following tags:
Key                 Value
dmmx:owner          bdh61@me.com
dmmx:project        turnstile
dmmx:create-date    2025-03-30
dmmx:tr:owner       dan.mohrland@thomsonreuters.com
