Generate a bash shell script to process compute.yaml.

The shell script should do the following:
1. Prompt the the user for parameters.
2. Execute the aws cli command to process compute.yaml and deploy
   the resource defined within.
3. Provide status updates while it waits for the resources to be created.
4. Provide output that indicates if the resources were created
   successfully or not.
5. If there was an error, provide information on the error.
